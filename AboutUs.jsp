Everyone must understand how the system is supposed to respond under a wide range of conditions, and the desired system response must be verified. A Web solution must be of high quality software. It must be thoroughly tested for presentation, performance, and reliability.<br />Our workforce is constantly exposed to various training courses on programming practices, software quality assurance and software engineering, and on specific tools and techniques such as configuration management, inspection and reviews. This process is supported by a hands-on quality assurance function and a comprehensive system of internal audits.
